      pargraph for eg in this case we acn see that even add a space in the code
      but still it will appear in the same line
    </p>
    <p>
      To edit a particuclar title in the code we will use (id) tag by using in
      the arrow box.

      If we want to add custom style in the code we will use google font that it
      can provide us the particular style.

      To use a google font we will copy the Url of the particular font and after
      that we can use it to code by pasting in the head tag of the code
      <a
        href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Dancing+Script?preview.text=Whereas%20recognition%20of%20the%20inherent%20dignity&preview.text_type=custom&category=Display,Handwriting"

      name of the font.

      property. Which is mention in the pixel. To change the align we will use
      it in body tag so as it will be treated as text
